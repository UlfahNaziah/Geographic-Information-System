a) Vector

Spatial data is based on a coordinate system that is commonly used to present a map that we can refresentasikan with Points (Point), Lines (Lines) and Polygons (Polygons / area). The main advantage we can get from the vector data that is a provision in the present point features, limitations and straight lines. It is certainly useful for analyzes that require precision positioning.

b) Raster Data

Data or spatial data objects presented sequentially in columns and rows in the form of cells that are often better known as pixels. In raster data, the resolution depends on the size of the pixel. In other words, the pixel resolution describes the actual size of the earth&#39;s surface represented by each pixel in the image. The smaller the size of the Earth&#39;s surface is presented by a cell, the higher the resolution.
